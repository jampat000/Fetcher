## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.5] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- `VERSION` file for app, installer metadata, and Web UI sidebar version.
- `LICENSE` (MIT), `CHANGELOG.md`, Dependabot (pip + Actions), `.github/release.yml`.
- CI **Test** workflow (`pytest` on Ubuntu); optional installer **Authenticode** signing (`scripts/sign-installer.ps1`).
- `RunOnceId` on Inno `[UninstallRun]` entries.

### Changed
- README: download link, install/first-run, signing and CI docs.
- Installer reads version from `-Version`, `GITHUB_REF_NAME` (`v*`), or `VERSION`.

## [1.0.4] - 2025-03-20

### Changed
- CI: dedupe concurrent installer builds for the same commit.
- Installer `AppVersion` follows `VERSION` / release tag.
- Tracked `packaging/grabby.spec` so GitHub Actions can build the installer.

## [1.0.3] - 2025-03-20

### Fixed
- PyInstaller/Inno CI failure: `grabby.spec` was gitignored and missing on runners.
